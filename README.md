2. Build and RunOpen your terminal in the abacus-app folder and run:docker compose up --build
The first time you run this, it will download the necessary images and set up the database.Note: If you are updating from an older version, you may need to reset the database schema:docker compose down -v
docker compose up --build
3.

If you modified init.sql, run docker compose down -v to reset the volume and apply changes.Q: The exam timer feels laggy.A: The timer uses a delta-time calculation to stay synced with the system clock, ensuring accuracy even if the browser slows down.Q: I assigned a level but the student can't see it.A: Ensure you selected the correct checkboxes during creation. You can verify the assigned levels in the Admin Dashboard table.
